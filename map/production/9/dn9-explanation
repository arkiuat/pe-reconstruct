While working on the 4th pass over DN 9 I noticed a blank 
segment that I hadn't picked up with the current procedure, dn9:8.1,
which is technically an anchor segment.

I failed to pick it up because it doesn't appear in the translation
JSON file at all, not even as a "" null string.  This probably has
something to do with the fact that in the root text it contains
exactly and only a single "pe", but I'm not sure how missing this
kind of thing might affect side-by-side and interlinear display of
an expanded sutta text, so I'm making a note of it here.

If I wanted to prevent this sort of thing in the future, the first
thing that comes to mind is, while continuing to get my *texts* for
each segment ID from the translation file, get the canonical list
of segments (and their IDs) for each sutta only from the ms/pli/root
texts. 

Up until now I've been obtaining both from just the translation
file, at least for purposes of preparing the pe-map.json and
pe-subst.json files.
