I just noticed that if we keep the anchor segment (with equivalent text), like so:

% grep dn2:43\.2 /dn8*
dn8-map-orig-setup.json:# "dn2:43.2 ANCHOR delete this segment (after virtnum reset), which replaces dn2:43.2",
dn8-penultimate-map.json:# "dn8:18.6 ANCHOR delete dn2:43.2",

instead of mapping it to its DN 2 equivalent, then we lose the commentary footnote, which is attached
to the DN 2 segment, but not present in the DN 8 cognate and so absent for this anchor segment. So in such
cases, we should map to DN 2, and 

PERHAPS WE NEED TO MAKE ALWAYS PREFERRING THE DN2 SEGMENT TO "this sutta's" SEGMENT A MATTER OF POLICY.

So I need to put that in policy. But I'm done with the fourth pass over DN 8 and this will have to wait
until the 5th pass.

###

dn8:19.1 could be mapped to any one of 
	dn2:56.1
	dn2:57.1
	dn2:58.1
	dn2:59.1
	dn2:60.1
	dn2:61.1
	dn2:62.1

On the fourth pass, I mapped it to dn2:62.1 for some reason.

But I like the virtual segment IDs that result from mapping it to
dn2:56.1 better, as I did on the third pass. So we're making this
a policy decision:

Always map dn8:19.1 to dn2:56.1

###

Below is a way I handled this before, but I decided it's better NOT
to have a special case in the code, because this can in fact be handled 
with a pe-subst.json entry. Which is how I'm handling it now.


### 

old way (and explanation of problem)
------------------------------------

dn8:20.1 and dn8:20.2 are an unnecessarily split anchor segment.
The two segments together correspond to a single DN2 segment,
dn2:83.1

The splitting and mismatch is in the PƒÅli root text, so there's no
messing around with it. I handled this by introducing some special
case code in the reconstruction script.

We map dn8:20.1 to dn2:83.1, and we map dn8:20.2 to the null string
(NOT the same thing as mapping it to a segment ID that points to a
null string). The special case code causes the script to assign a null
string as the final text for that segment (and there are many such
already in the translations of these suttas) and not go looking for
its text from the original sutta (default behavior for a segment
ID that doesn't appear in the map).

If we just left dn8:20.2 out of the map file, it would assume it
was a correct line from DN 8 (it's totally not, it's just a fragment
of one) and include it, unmodified, in the result.
