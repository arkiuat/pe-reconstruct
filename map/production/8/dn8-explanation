Below is a way I handled this before, but I decided it's better NOT
to have a special case in the code, because this can in fact be handled 
with a pe-subst.json entry. Which is how I'm handling it now.


### old way (and explanation of problem)

dn8:20.1 and dn8:20.2 are an unnecessarily split anchor segment.
The two segments together correspond to a single DN2 segment,
dn2:83.1

The splitting and mismatch is in the PƒÅli root text, so there's no
messing around with it. I handled this by introducing some special
case code in the reconstruction script.

We map dn8:20.1 to dn2:83.1, and we map dn8:20.2 to the null string
(NOT the same thing as mapping it to a segment ID that points to a
null string). The special case code causes the script to assign a null
string as the final text for that segment (and there are many such
already in the translations of these suttas) and not go looking for
its text from the original sutta (default behavior for a segment
ID that doesn't appear in the map).

If we just left dn8:20.2 out of the map file, it would assume it
was a correct line from DN 8 (it's totally not, it's just a fragment
of one) and include it, unmodified, in the result.
