1. seriously consider whether it's better to apply substitutions before mappings, and rewrite the raku script if so
2. finish the fourth pass over all the map & subst jsons while rewriting procedure (currently finishing step 5)
3. finish fixing up the pli/ms subst.jsons to support side-by-side & interlinear
4. finish the write-up that Bhante Khemaratana expressed interest in 

I think after 3. is done, you can advertise the repo on SC.D&D, and then start work on #3
