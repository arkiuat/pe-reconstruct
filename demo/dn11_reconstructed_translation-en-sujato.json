  "dn11:83.1": "For a third time, that mendicant said to the Great Divinity, ",
  "dn11:83.2": "‘Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are ",
  "dn11:83.3": "the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. ",
  "dn11:83.4": "I am asking ",
  "dn11:83.5": "where these four principal states cease without anything left over.’ ",
  "dn11:83.6": "Then the Great Divinity took that mendicant by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him, ",
  "dn11:83.7": "‘Mendicant, these gods think that there is nothing at all that I don’t know and see and understand and realize. ",
  "dn11:83.8": "That’s why I didn’t answer in front of them. ",
  "dn11:83.9": "But I too do not know where these four principal states cease with nothing left over. ",
  "dn11:83.10": "Therefore, mendicant, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone, in that you passed over the Buddha and searched elsewhere for an answer to this question. ",
  "dn11:83.11": "Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.’ ",
  "dn11:84.1": "Then that mendicant, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me. ",
  "dn11:84.2": "Then he bowed, sat down to one side, and said to me, ",
  "dn11:84.3": "‘Sir, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ ",
  "dn11:85.0": "4.1. The Simile of the Land-Spotting Bird ",
  "dn11:85.1": "When he said this, I said to him: ",
  "dn11:85.2": "‘Once upon a time, mendicant, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird. ",
  "dn11:85.3": "When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird. ",
  "dn11:85.4": "It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between. ",
  "dn11:85.5": "If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed. ",
  "dn11:85.6": "But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship. ",
  "dn11:85.7": "In the same way, after failing to get an answer to this question even after searching as far as the realm of divinity, you’ve returned to me. ",
  "dn11:85.8": "Mendicant, this is not how the question should be asked: ",
  "dn11:85.9": "“Sir, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?” ",
  "dn11:85.10": "This is how the question should be asked: ",
  "dn11:85.11": "“Where do water and earth, ",
  "dn11:85.12": "fire and air not remain; ",
  "dn11:85.13": "where long and short, ",
  "dn11:85.14": "fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly? ",
  "dn11:85.15": "Where does name-and-form ",
  "dn11:85.16": "cease with nothing left over?” ",
  "dn11:85.17": "And the answer to that is: ",
  "dn11:85.18": "“‘Consciousness where no form appears, ",
  "dn11:85.19": "infinite, luminous all-round.’ ",
  "dn11:85.20": "Regarding this, water and earth, ",
  "dn11:85.21": "fire and air do not remain; ",
  "dn11:85.22": "regarding this, long and short, ",
  "dn11:85.23": "fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly. ",
  "dn11:85.24": "Regarding this, name and form ",
  "dn11:85.25": "ceases with nothing left over—",
  "dn11:85.26": "with the cessation of consciousness, ",
  "dn11:85.27": "they cease in reference to this.”’” ",
  "dn11:85.28": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "dn11:85.29": "Satisfied, the householder Kevaḍḍha approved what the Buddha said. "
