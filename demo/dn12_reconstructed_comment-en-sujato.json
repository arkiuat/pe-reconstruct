  "dn12:63.3": "This is the “coarse” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>olārika</i>) body. Note that its generation by mother and father contradicts the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala.

This term does not appear anywhere in the Pali canon. ",
  "dn12:65.1": "The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation. The higher powers in Buddhism are regarded as extensions and evolutions of aspects of ordinary experience, not as metaphysical realities separate from the world of mundane experience. ",
  "dn12:65.2": "This is similar to the experience of the “astral body” described by modern spiritualists. Note that it is still “physical” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpī</i>) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhuma</i>) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind. ",

  "dn12:67.2": "Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts.

  "dn12:72.1": "Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear. ",
  "dn12:73.1": "Here begins the “three knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tevijjā</i>), a subset of the six direct knowledges.

  "dn12:73.2": "Empowered by the fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness. ",
  "dn12:74.1": "The word for “past life” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pubbanivāsa</i>, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey. ",

(2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects. (3) All functions relating to the four noble truths have been completed, namely: understanding suffering, letting go craving, witnessing extinguishment, and developing the path.
