  "dn6:3.1": "Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita, ",

  "dn6:5.3": "Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said: ",
  "dn6:5.4": "‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’ ",

  "dn6:13.2": "“Firstly, Mahāli, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. ",
  "dn6:13.3": "This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me. ",
  "dn6:13.4": "Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. ",
  "dn6:13.5": "This too is one of the finer things. ",
  "dn6:13.6": "Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. ",
  "dn6:13.7": "This too is one of the finer things. ",
  "dn6:13.8": "Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. ",
  "dn6:13.9": "This too is one of the finer things. ",
  "dn6:13.10": "These are the finer things, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.” ",
  "dn6:14.0": "2.3. The Noble Eightfold Path ",

  "dn6:16.4.2.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "dn6:16.4.2.7": "After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn6:16.4.3.1": "Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. ",

  "dn6:16.4.4.0.2": "2.4.1.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics ",
  "dn6:16.4.4.1": "And how, reverends, is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? ",
  "dn6:16.4.4.2": "It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings. ",
  "dn6:16.4.4.3": "This pertains to their ethics. ",
  "dn6:16.4.4.4": "They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. ",
