  "dn9:1.4": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
  "dn9:2.1": "Then it occurred to him, ",
  "dn9:2.2": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. ",
  "dn9:2.3": "Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?” ",
  "dn9:2.4": "So that’s what he did. ",
  "dn9:3.1": "Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as ",
  "dn9:3.2": "talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that place.

  "dn9:4.1": "Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, ",
  "dn9:4.2": "and hushed his own assembly, ",
  "dn9:4.3": "“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. ",

  "dn9:6.3": "It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later. ",
  "dn9:6.4": "Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and a discussion about the cessation of perception came up among them: ",
  "dn9:6.5": "‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’ ",
  "dn9:6.6": "Some of them said: ",
  "dn9:6.7": "‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason. ",
  "dn9:6.8": "When they arise, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.9": "When they cease, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.10": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.11": "But someone else says: ",
  "dn9:6.12": "‘That’s not how it is, good fellows! ",
  "dn9:6.13": "Perception is a person’s self, ",
  "dn9:6.14": "which enters and departs. ",
  "dn9:6.15": "When it enters, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.16": "When it departs, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.17": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.18": "But someone else says: ",
  "dn9:6.19": "‘That’s not how it is, good fellows! ",
  "dn9:6.20": "There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might. ",
  "dn9:6.21": "They insert and extract a person’s perception. ",
  "dn9:6.22": "When they insert it, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.23": "When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.24": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",

  "dn9:6.26": "‘That’s not how it is, good fellows! ",
  "dn9:6.27": "There are deities of great power and might. ",
  "dn9:6.28": "They insert and extract a person’s perception. ",
  "dn9:6.29": "When they insert it, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.30": "When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.31": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.32": "That reminded me of the Buddha: ",
  "dn9:6.33": "‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so very skilled in such matters.’ ",
  "dn9:6.34": "The Buddha is skilled and well-versed concerning the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.35": "How does the cessation of perception happen?” ",
  "dn9:7.0": "1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause ",
  "dn9:7.1": "“Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that ",
  "dn9:7.2": "a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start. ",
  "dn9:7.3": "Why is that? ",
  "dn9:7.4": "Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason. ",
  "dn9:7.5": "With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:7.6": "And what is that training?” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:7.7": "“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. ",
  "dn9:7.7.1.2": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "dn9:7.7.1.3": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.1": "A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family. ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.2": "They gain faith in the Realized One ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.3": "and reflect: ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.4": "‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open. ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.5": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "dn9:7.7.2.7": "After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn9:7.7.3.1": "Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct.
