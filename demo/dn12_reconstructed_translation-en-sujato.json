  "dn12:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā. ",
  "dn12:1.3": "Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. ",
  "dn12:2.1": "Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception: ",
  "dn12:2.2": "“Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? ",
  "dn12:2.3": "Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. ",
  "dn12:2.4": "That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?” ",
  "dn12:3.1": "Lohicca heard: ",
  "dn12:3.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. ",
  "dn12:3.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "dn12:3.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "dn12:3.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "dn12:3.6": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "dn12:3.7": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "dn12:4.1": "Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika, ",
  "dn12:4.2": "“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "dn12:4.3": "",
  "dn12:4.4": "And then ask him whether he, ",
  "dn12:4.5": "together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might please accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.” ",
  "dn12:5.1": "“Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and ",

  "dn12:5.3": "",
  "dn12:5.4": "",
  "dn12:5.5": "the Buddha consented with silence. ",
  "dn12:6.1": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, went to Lohicca, and said to him, ",

  "dn12:6.4": "",
  "dn12:6.5": "",

  "dn12:7.2": "“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying: ",
  "dn12:7.3": "‘It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.’” ",

  "dn12:7.6": "",
  "dn12:7.7": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. ",

  "dn12:9.1": "Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. ",

  "dn12:9.6": "“Is it really true, Lohicca, that you have such a harmful misconception: ",

  "dn12:16.4": "Firstly, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn12:16.5": "They teach their disciples: ",
  "dn12:16.6": "‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ ",

  "dn12:16.11": "they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. ",
  "dn12:16.12": "It’s like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away, or embraces her though she turns her back. ",

  "dn12:21.7": "After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn12:22.1": "Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
