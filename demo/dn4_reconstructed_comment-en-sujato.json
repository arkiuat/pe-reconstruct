  "dn4:9.3": "This stock passage indicates different attitudes towards the Buddha, and perhaps also different social status. Examples of such behaviors are given in Dharmaśāstras. While they might not exactly apply to this situation, they do indicate that these behaviors were nuanced and deliberate. Here is an example: “One should rise to greet a sacrificial priest, father-in-law, paternal uncle, or maternal uncle who is younger than oneself, but not verbally salute him. Likewise, one should rise to greet, but not verbally salute a different fellow-citizen who is older than oneself—even a Śūdra provided he is at least eighty—if one is equal in age to his son. And a Śūdra should rise to greet, but not verbally salute an Ārya, even if he is younger than himself.”  (Gautama 6.9–11, translation David Brick). ",

  "dn4:23.6.3.1": "Situational awareness is a psychological term popularized in the 1990s. It has to do with the perception of environmental phenomena and the comprehension of their meaning, which is very close to the sense of the Pali term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sampajañña</i>. ",

So it seems the sense is “before the face” or more generally “in the presence”. | To “establish mindfulness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā</i>) is literally to “do satipaṭṭhāna”. ",

  "dn4:23.8": "Each <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> begins as the least refined aspect of the previous <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> ends.

  "dn4:23.8.2.1": "The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. ",
  "dn4:23.8.2.2": "The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss. ",
  "dn4:23.9": "The emotional response to bliss matures from the subtle thrill of rapture to the poise of equanimity. Mindfulness is present in all states of deep meditation, but with equanimity it becomes prominent. ",
  "dn4:23.9.2.1": "The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss. ",
  "dn4:23.10": "The emotional poise of equanimity leads to the feeling of pleasure settling into the more subtle neutral feeling. Pain and sadness have been abandoned long before, but are emphasized here as they are subtle counterpart of pleasure. ",

  "dn4:23.10.2.1": "The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content. ",
  "dn4:23.11": "Of the eight kinds of knowledge and vision, only the last is considered indispensable. The fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> is the ideal basis for developing higher knowledges, although elsewhere the canon shows that even the first <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> can be a basis for liberating insight. Without <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, however, the eightfold path is incomplete and liberating insight is impossible. | The verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhininnāmeti</i> (“extend”) indicates that the meditator comes out of full immersion like a tortoise sticking out its limbs (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240/en/sujato#1.7'>SN 35.240:1.7</a>). ",
  "dn4:23.11.1.3": "This is the “coarse” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>olārika</i>) body. Note that its generation by mother and father contradicts the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala. The obvious impermanence of the body invites the tempting but fallacious notion that the mind or soul is permanent, which is dispelled by deeper insight. ",
  "dn4:23.11.1.4": "This distinction should not be mistaken for mind-body dualism. These are not fundamental substances but experiences of a meditator. ",
  "dn4:23.11.2.2": "Strung gems were loved in India from the time in the Harappan civilization, millennia before the Buddha. ",
  "dn4:23.11.2.6": "This form of “knowledge and vision” is rarely mentioned, being found only here, at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn10/en/sujato#2.21.3'>DN 10:2.21.3</a>, and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#29.2'>MN 77:29.2</a>.

This term does not appear anywhere in the Pali canon. ",
  "dn4:23.11.3.1": "The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation. The higher powers in Buddhism are regarded as extensions and evolutions of aspects of ordinary experience, not as metaphysical realities separate from the world of mundane experience. ",
  "dn4:23.11.3.2": "This is similar to the experience of the “astral body” described by modern spiritualists. Note that it is still “physical” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpī</i>) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhuma</i>) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind. ",
  "dn4:23.11.5.1": "Here begin the “six direct knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>chaḷabhiññā</i>), which are found commonly throughout the early texts. | “Psychic powers” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>iddhi</i>) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals.

  "dn4:23.11.5.2": "Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts.

  "dn4:23.11.7.1": "“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibbasota</i>. The root sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibba</i> is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present. ",
  "dn4:23.11.7.2": "The Buddha occasionally used this ability for teaching, as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato#6.1'>MN 75:6.1</a>. ",

  "dn4:23.11.10.1": "Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear. ",
  "dn4:23.11.11.1": "Here begins the “three knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tevijjā</i>), a subset of the six direct knowledges.

  "dn4:23.11.11.2": "Empowered by the fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness. ",
  "dn4:23.11.12.1": "The word for “past life” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pubbanivāsa</i>, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey. ",
